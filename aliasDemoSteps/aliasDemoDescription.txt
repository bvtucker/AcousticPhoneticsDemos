AliasDemo.praat  
AliasDemo.praat is a praat script that
generates a series of tone pips, each of
which is a segment of a sinusoid.

There are 4 menu items that can be edited

StepHz :  (default 1000 Hz) -- the frequency of the first pip
 and the separation between each pair of pips.

StepMs:   (default 100 ms) 
	 -- the duration of each pip

durSec: (default 1 s)  
	-- the maximum total duration of the whole tone sequence.

SamplingFreq:   (default 20000)
	  sampling rate in Hz.

With the default settings:
you hear a set of tone pips of increasing frequency
starting at  1000 Hz and going to 10,000 Hz.

Exercises:
1) Leave everything EXCEPT the sampling frequency
at their default values.
Change the SamplingFreq something less
than 20000 Hz but at 10000 Hz or above,
you'll hear tone go up, then down. 

2) Repeat, but set SamplingFreq to a value
lower than 10000 Hz.
You'll hear it go up then down then up
and if SamplingFreq  is low enough, down again..

Note: The program sets
Spectrum:Spectrogram settings...:Window length (s)
 to 0.020, so the (narrow-band) spectrogram
 should show a clear picture of the sine pips you produced
and should correspond to the up-down pattern of what you heard.
