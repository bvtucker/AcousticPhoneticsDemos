# Acoustic Phonetics Demos

This is a repo for storing scripts and other examples I use when teaching acoustic phonetics.

Many of my script demos come from T.M. Nearey and are posted here with his permission.

The scripts include praat script demos and Matlab demos.

TwoTubeNomograms - Are two separate matlab codes that generate two tube estimations for a-like and i-like vowels. As the resonant frequencies are calculated a two-tube model is illustrated with a figure and as the tube lengths are changed it shows the resonant frequencies as it steps through all possible variations. The final output of the calculations are then plotted as a nomogram. The i-like nomogram includes the helmholtz resonance.
