# Acoustic Phonetics Demos

This is a repo for storing scripts and other examples I use when teaching acoustic phonetics.

Many of my script demos come from T.M. Nearey and are posted here with his permission.

The scripts include praat script demos and Matlab demos.

**AliasDemo** is a praat script that generates a series of tone pips, each of which is a segment of a sinusoid.

**LPCVocoderPraatDemoF** This is a praat script with some accompanying sound files that allows students to try vocoding. This script is set up to take recorded speech and replace the source with noise, a buzzz, and a harmonica. 

**SimpleVowelTransferFunction** This is a praat script that can be used to demonstrate the addition of a sources and transfer function to create a vowel. It plays the source and the combined sound and then outputs 3 images in the picture window: the spectrum of the source, the spectrum of the transfer function and the spectrum of the output.

**TwoTubeNomograms** - Are two separate matlab codes that generate two tube estimations for a-like and i-like vowels. As the resonant frequencies are calculated a two-tube model is illustrated with a figure and as the tube lengths are changed it shows the resonant frequencies as it steps through all possible variations. The final output of the calculations are then plotted as a nomogram. The i-like nomogram includes the helmholtz resonance.
